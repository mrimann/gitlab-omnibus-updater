Introduction:
-------------

This is just a small script to update an existing Gitlab instance to a newer version. Basically it just executes the commands from the Gitlab documentation, but in an automated way (hint: automation).

This is tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with GiLab Omnibus 7.3.x

**ATTENTION** Since v7.10.4 something does not work anymore, I tried to fix it but couldn't find an easy solution. The Gitlab guys started to publish their own *.deb repositories which probably makes this script useless at all.


How to update GitLab?
---------------------

Just grab the script, make it executable and run it like this::

	sudo /path/to/update-gitlab-omnibus.sh

While it was an idea on it's own to create this script, I also looked for existing solutions. The script is somewhat inspired by the work of https://github.com/heichblatt/gitlab-omnibus-update - thanks!
